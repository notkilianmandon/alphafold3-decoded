    - AddGlobalAtomIdAnnotation: Adds range(N) as a global atom id annotation. We don't need that, but ourselves, 
        but the Atomworks Cropping transforms for training require the transform.

        or modified residues. We use this flag in ConcatMSAs and CalculateBondMatrix. 
    - our custom transforms construct the actual features based on the AtomArray.
